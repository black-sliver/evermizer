HOWTO:
0. ROM has to be NTSC/US and can be a 3MB .SFC file with or without 512B header
1. Visit the in-browser version, unpack the exe or compile main.c
2. Drag and drop your rom into the in-browser field or onto the .exe
3a In-browser version should present you checkboxes in your browser and offer
   the patched ROM as "download" or show messages in an alert box.
3b Exe should ask you for settings and spit out success or error in a "dos"
   window, create a file starting with "Evermizer" in source ROM's directory
   and print out the complete filename.
4. Checksum is wrong, but neither FXPAK nor tested emulators seem to care
5. You can skip the intro by pressing start (even without a prior save)
6. You have to loot gourds/chests, check alchemists or kill Thraxx to get a
   weapon that can cut grass to get access to the Windwalker.
7. If you have questions or need help, continue reading below, check the guide

CHANGES SO FAR:
  This is still far from complete.
  Crude user interface to select seed and settings
    Default output filename includes settings and seed number
    Option to save a spoiler log
  Command line interface:
    Allow batch processing
    Allow to specify complete output filename with -o
    Allow to specify output directory with -d
    Run the program without any file/arguments to see possible arguments
    Run the program in UI mode or with --settings to see possible settings
  Energy Core:
    Vanilla places it in its original location under the chessboard
    Shuffle converts the vanilla Energy Core to be a chest
    Fragment converts it to a chest and places multiple fragments into
      random chests. Use pool (see below) to shuffle them to other places.
      Trade for the real Energy Core at Prof. Ruffleberg.
  Ingredienizer:
    Randomize ingredient requirements
    Scales with difficulty
    Goes crazy with "Full"
  Alchemizer: "On" randomizes where you get which alchemy and
    Make sure Atlas is obtainable and usable in Easy and Normal
    Make sure Levitate and Revealer is obtainable and usable when required
    Newly learned alchemy is now preselected/highlighted for alchemy selection
    Strong Heart only teaches one formula, the other one is in the market
    "Pool" shuffles spells with other enabled pools
    (Dialogs still unchanged)
  Boss dropamizer: "On" randomizes what each boss drops and

    Bridges in pyramid won't collapse
    Horace spawn and dialog is changed (tied to DEs in inventory or DEs lost)
    Tinker taking away your diamond eyes sets flag to not lock-out Aegis
    If gourdomizer is on as well, you can go back through Big Bug after Thraxx
    "Pool" shuffles boss drops with other enabled pools
  Gourdomizer: "On" shuffles gourd/pot/chest drops, no gourds are missable and
    "Pool" shuffles gourd drops with other enabled pools
  Mixed Pool Strategy: when pooling is enabled
    "Balance" keeps the amount of key items in each pool constant
    "Random" may redistribute key items randomly
    "Bosses" will move all key items to bosses
  Sniffamizer: "On" shuffles, "Full" randomizes dog-sniff ingredients
  Callbeadmizer: "On" swaps call bead rings, "Full" shuffles individual spells
  Doggomizer: "On" swaps, "Full" randomizes the dog in your party
    Act1-3 only because toaster evasion sound hardlocks for some music tracks
  Pupdunk: Act0 doggo everywhere!
  Musicmizer: randomize music, in testing stage
  Sequence breaks: Fix, allow or "in logic" (possibly requiring it)

  Shorter dialogs:
    Cut some dialogs and cutscenes. This is work in progress.
  Short boss rush:
    Start boss rush at Metal Magmar. Cut enemy HP in half.
  Turdo Mode:
    Replaces all offensive spells, weakens weapons, reduces enemies' Magic Def.
  Open world: Unlock windwalker in every fire pit (slashing weapon required)
    Grant access to inner volcano
    Grant access to east swamp

    Act1 top-of-volcano guy fixed
    Act3 Mungola HP / fight fixed
    Act1 move Coleoptera behind talking to FE after killing Thraxx

    Don't despawn North Market rock when Aegis is dead
    Replaced FE Village Windwalker checks with Magmar-dead checks

  Vanilla bugs fixed:
    Fix softlock when entering west prison with dead dog

    Fix softlock when you have more than 3 rocket parts
    Fix texts disappearing when you fall down in Ruins NW room
    Removed option to save at Madronius' Brother
    Fix softlock when leaving tiny's lair

STILL TO BE FIXED:
  Show info to the player if market timer is over but Vigor won't spawn yet
    you have to jump down the ravine next to Blimp's cave
  Act3 can have camera location bugs in houses until blindly talked to Lance
    saving and loading is a work-around
  A lot of vanilla crashes/softlocks
